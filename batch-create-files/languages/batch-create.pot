"USER_EMAIL,USER_ROLE<br /><br /> BLOG_NAME = The name of the blog you want "

"want the user to have a blog, please set this to 'null' without the "
"quotation marks. No spaces allowed.<br /><br /> BLOG_TITLE = The title of "
"the blog. This can be changed later.<br /><br /> USER_NAME = The name of the "
"user. No spaces allowed.<br /><br /> USER_PASS = If you would like a "
"password auto-generated please set this to 'null' without the quotation "
"marks. No spaces allowed.<br /><br /> USER_EMAIL = You must provide a valid "
"email for each user<br /><br /> USER_ROLE = The user role (when the user is "
"added to an existing blog).<br /><br /> Examples:<br /><br /> User with blog "
"and preset password:<br /> demoblogname1,Demo Blog Title 1,username1,"
"userpass1, useremail@domain.com<br /><br /> User with blog and auto-"

"p> <p> <strong>Please Note</strong><br /><br /> Spam filters, especially "
"strict ones for institutional email addresses, may well block username and "
"login information from reaching users.<br /><br /> In this case you should "
"either try to use free webmail accounts that won't block the emails (such as "
"gmail.com, hotmail.com or mail.yahoo.com) or preset passwords.<br /><br /> "
"If your users do not have email accounts you can still set them up using a "
"gmail.com address and adding a number for each different user. For example: "
"myname+1@gmail.com, myname+2@gmail.com, myname+3@gmail.com<br /><br /> The "
"system will treat each of these as a separate email account but they will "
"all arrive at myname@gmail.com. </p> "
